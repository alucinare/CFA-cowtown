Jamie doesn't really like how rails handles JS because of Turbolinks
When we follow a link Turbolink uses an ajax request that doesn't require us to refresh the page. it gets the new body and puts the content in the body. Alot of JS gets brought in through the head so that maybe problem because it doesn't know to get the JS file from the head and it won't link it up.

The way to get aronud it is through PAGE CHANGES EVENTS in ruby guides 5.2 - which is written in coffescript.

ORR

we can turn off turbo links by deleting the data-turbolinks-track in the JS head and remove the turbolinks line in the application.js
rails popularised coffeescript JS because JS was really really poor in syntax, however, CS fell out of favour because the newest version of JS is neater and there isn't as many useful guides

if we want more dynamic site we might need a JS framework to make it faster.


TURBOLINKS
<HTML>
  <HEAD>
    CSS/JS
    meta tags
    /any extra file that we may need/
  </HEAD>


a log in rails is anything that the server does.


Mailer,

don't worry about bootstrap or sass
rails g mailer ContactMailer - Contact can be any word for whatever it is used for.
mailgun is good server because it is free... you'll get credentials for this and they will give it to you. Don't use the ones in the guide.

THis is to open up the bash file to create environmental variables (ENV): atom ~/.zshrc
